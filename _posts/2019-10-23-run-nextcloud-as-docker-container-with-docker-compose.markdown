I've set up my private cloud using [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/). Because I'm a huge fan of
Docker, I decided to run Nextcloud as a Docker container. Luckily, there's an official
[Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud) and they also provide examples on how
to run Nextcloud with a standalone database using Docker Compose.

## Basic setup

The basic setup without subdomain, without TLS and without a reverse proxy is super easy. The corresponding `docker-compose.yml` looks like this:

```yaml
---
version: '3'
services:
  nextcloud:
    image: "nextcloud:17.0.0-apache"
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - nextcloud:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=<MYSQL_PASSWORD>
      - MYSQL_HOST=mariadb
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER=<NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER>
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD>
  mariadb:
    image: "mariadb:10.4.8-bionic"
    command: "--transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED --binlog-format=ROW"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD>
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=<MYSQL_PASSWORD>
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
volumes:
  nextcloud:
  db:
```

## Advanced setup

Now, suppose we want to add a reverse proxy like NGINX in front of Nextcloud because we might want to run several applications behind different subdomains on our server. Furthermore, we want to secure our connection to Nextcloud through TLS because we don't want that all our private data is transfered in plaintext over the internet:

<!--
```plantuml
@startuml

together {
    actor Client
    node Server {
        node "Docker Daemon" {
            together {
                node NGINX
            }
            together {
                node "App1"
                node "App2"
                node Nextcloud
            }
        }
    }
}

NGINX -[hidden]-> Nextcloud
NGINX -[hidden]-> App1
NGINX -[hidden]-> App2

Client-> NGINX : cloud.example.com
NGINX -> App1 : app1.example.com
NGINX -> App2 : app2.example.com
NGINX -> Nextcloud : cloud.example.com

To realize this scenario, we need to make these changes:

* The Docker containers of NGINX and Nextcloud (+ MariaDB) need to run on the same Docker network so that NGINX can proxy traffic to Nextcloud. I suppose that you already have a running NGINX with TLS setup ([read this for a how-to](https://medium.com/@pentacent/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-wit
h-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71)). **Make sure to use the appropriate network name!** When using Docker Compose, the network name is a concatenation of the directory name (where the `docker-compose.yml` is stored) + the name of the NGINX container + `network` (each part separated by hyphens). In my case the NGINX is running inside a Docker network called `apps_nginx_network`.

* Now that the Docker containers of NGINX and Nextcloud run inside the same network, there's no need to expose the port of Nextcloud (â†’ remove port mapping).

* For reasons of security, Nextcloud prints an error message when it is run on a subdomain. This is why we set the environment variable `NEXTCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAINS` to our subdomain.

**Resulting configuration:**

```yaml
---
version: '3'
services:
  nextcloud:
    image: "nextcloud:17.0.0-apache"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - nextcloud:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=<MYSQL_PASSWORD>
      - MYSQL_HOST=mariadb
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER=<NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER>
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD>
      - NEXTCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAINS=cloud.example.com
    networks:
      - <NAME_OF_NGINX_DOCKER_NETWORK>
  mariadb:
    image: "mariadb:10.4.8-bionic"
    command: "--transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED --binlog-format=ROW"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD>
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=<MYSQL_PASSWORD>
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
    networks:
      - <NAME_OF_NGINX_DOCKER_NETWORK>
volumes:
  nextcloud:
  db:
networks:
  <NAME_OF_NGINX_DOCKER_NETWORK>:
    external: true  
```

**Forward traffic from NGINX to Nextcloud:**

Because NGINX and Nextcloud run inside the same Docker network, they can ping / reach eachother through their container names (= their hostnames). That means, in this example the NGINX container can forward traffic to Nextcloud through `http://nextcloud:80`.

Your NGINX configuration could look similar to this:

```conf
...

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name cloud.example.com;
    server_tokens off;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/cloud.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/cloud.example.com/privkey.pem;

    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://nextcloud:80/;
        proxy_set_header    Host                $http_host;
        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP           $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For     $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

...
```
